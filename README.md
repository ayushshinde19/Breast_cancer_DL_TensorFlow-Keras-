# Breast_cancer_DL_TensorFlow-Keras-
A deep learning model to classify breast tumors as Malignant or Benign using histopathology images or structured clinical data.
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Deep Neural Network (DNN) / Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras to predict breast cancer malignancy from:

Structured data (e.g., Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset)

Medical images (e.g., histopathology slides from the BreakHis dataset)

The model aids in early diagnosis, achieving high accuracy in classification tasks.

âœ¨ Key Features
âœ” Deep Learning Models:

DNN for tabular data (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow).

CNN for image-based classification (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet).
âœ” Preprocessing Pipeline:

Handles missing values, normalization, and augmentation (for images).
âœ” Model Interpretability:

Uses SHAP/Grad-CAM to explain predictions.
âœ” Deployment-Ready:

Supports Flask/FastAPI for web app deployment.
